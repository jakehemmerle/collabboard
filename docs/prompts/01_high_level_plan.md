@../COLLABBOARD_CORE.md

Take a look at this document. This is a requirements document that we are going to implement this week. I want to create a high-level implementation plan. I have a few decisions I want to go with, including using Konva.js, Firebase, Bun, and claude for the AI model.

I want to produce a set of high level phases that will complete the work defined by the "MVP Requirements". I will reiterate them here:

Hard gate. All items required to pass:

- ☐ Infinite board with pan/zoom
- ☐ Sticky notes with editable text
- ☐ At least one shape type (rectangle, circle, or line)
- ☐ Create, move, and edit objects
- ☐ Real-time sync between 2+ users
- ☐ Multiplayer cursors with name labels
- ☐ Presence awareness (who's online)
- ☐ User authentication
- ☐ Deployed and publicly accessible

Propose a series of phases that gets the project up from zero to hero. You can use as many phases as you want. Make sure each phase describes at a high level what needs to be done in this phase and what the acceptance criteria is. Make sure we provide a way of verifying the correctness of scaffolding or code at the end of each phase such as containers are able to be built and spun up, the code should compile and run in the browser (and needs to be manually checked), etc.

Let me know if you have any questions before we get started.
