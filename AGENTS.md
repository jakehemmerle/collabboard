## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a new file that you yourself created, such as a test code file. You have a horrible track record of deleting critically important files or otherwise throwing away tons of expensive work. As a result, you have permanently lost any and all rights to determine that a file or folder should be deleted.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS ASK AND RECEIVE CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE EVER DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND.**

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval. "I think it's safe" is never acceptable.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, request permission to use non-destructive options (`git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups) before ever considering a destructive command.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for a confirmation that your understanding is correct. Only then may you execute it—if anything remains ambiguous, refuse and escalate.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command, record (in the session notes / final response) the exact user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the execution time. If that record is absent, the operation did not happen.

## Backwards Compatibility

We do not care about backwards compatibility—we're in early development with no users. We want to do things the **RIGHT** way with **NO TECH DEBT**.

- Never create "compatibility shims"
- Never create wrapper functions for deprecated APIs
- Just fix the code directly

## Beads Workflow Integration

This project uses [beads_viewer](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/beads_viewer) for issue tracking. Issues are stored in `.beads/` and tracked in git.

### Essential Commands

```bash
# View issues (launches TUI - avoid in automated sessions)
bv

# CLI commands for agents (use these instead)
br ready              # Show issues ready to work (no blockers)
br list --status=open # All open issues
br show <id>          # Full issue details with dependencies
br create -t task -p 2 "Issue title here"
br update <id> --status=in_progress
br close <id> --reason="Completed"
br close <id1> <id2>  # Close multiple issues at once
br sync               # Export beads DB to .beads/issues.jsonl (does NOT run git)
```

### Workflow Pattern

1. **Start**: Run `br ready` to find actionable work
2. **Claim**: Use `br update <id> --status=in_progress`
3. **Work**: Implement the task
4. **Complete**: Use `br close <id>`
5. **Sync**: Always run `br sync` at session end

### Key Concepts

- **Dependencies**: Issues can block other issues. `br ready` shows only unblocked work.
- **Priority**: P0=critical, P1=high, P2=medium, P3=low, P4=backlog (use numbers, not words)
- **Types**: task, bug, feature, epic, question, docs
- **Blocking**: `br dep add <issue> <depends-on>` to add dependencies

### Session Protocol

**Before ending any session, run this checklist:**

```bash
git status              # Check what changed
br sync                 # Export beads DB to .beads/issues.jsonl
git add <files>         # Stage code changes (including .beads/)
git commit -m "..."     # Commit code + beads changes
git push                # Push to remote
```

### Best Practices

- Check `br ready` at session start to find available work
- Update status as you work (in_progress → closed)
- Create new issues with `br create` when you discover tasks
- Use descriptive titles and set appropriate priority/type
- Always `br sync` before ending session

## bv — Graph-Aware Triage Engine

bv is a graph-aware triage engine for Beads projects (`.beads/beads.jsonl`). It computes PageRank, betweenness, critical path, cycles, HITS, eigenvector, and k-core metrics deterministically.

**Scope boundary:** bv handles *what to work on* (triage, priority, planning). For agent-to-agent coordination (messaging, work claiming, file reservations), use MCP Agent Mail.

**CRITICAL: Use ONLY `--robot-*` flags. Bare `bv` launches an interactive TUI that blocks your session.**

### The Workflow: Start With Triage

**`bv --robot-triage` is your single entry point.** It returns:

- `quick_ref`: at-a-glance counts + top 3 picks
- `recommendations`: ranked actionable items with scores, reasons, unblock info
- `quick_wins`: low-effort high-impact items
- `blockers_to_clear`: items that unblock the most downstream work
- `project_health`: status/type/priority distributions, graph metrics
- `commands`: copy-paste shell commands for next steps

```bash
bv --robot-triage        # THE MEGA-COMMAND: start here
bv --robot-next          # Minimal: just the single top pick + claim command
```

### Command Reference

**Planning:**

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-plan` | Parallel execution tracks with `unblocks` lists |
| `--robot-priority` | Priority misalignment detection with confidence |

**Graph Analysis:**

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-insights` | Full metrics: PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, critical path, cycles, k-core, articulation points, slack |
| `--robot-label-health` | Per-label health: `health_level`, `velocity_score`, `staleness`, `blocked_count` |
| `--robot-label-flow` | Cross-label dependency: `flow_matrix`, `dependencies`, `bottleneck_labels` |
| `--robot-label-attention [--attention-limit=N]` | Attention-ranked labels |

**History & Change Tracking:**

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-history` | Bead-to-commit correlations |
| `--robot-diff --diff-since <ref>` | Changes since ref: new/closed/modified issues, cycles |

**Other:**

| Command | Returns |
|---------|---------|
| `--robot-burndown <sprint>` | Sprint burndown, scope changes, at-risk items |
| `--robot-forecast <id\|all>` | ETA predictions with dependency-aware scheduling |
| `--robot-alerts` | Stale issues, blocking cascades, priority mismatches |
| `--robot-suggest` | Hygiene: duplicates, missing deps, label suggestions |
| `--robot-graph [--graph-format=json\|dot\|mermaid]` | Dependency graph export |
| `--export-graph <file.html>` | Interactive HTML visualization |

### Scoping & Filtering

```bash
bv --robot-plan --label backend              # Scope to label's subgraph
bv --robot-insights --as-of HEAD~30          # Historical point-in-time
bv --recipe actionable --robot-plan          # Pre-filter: ready to work
bv --recipe high-impact --robot-triage       # Pre-filter: top PageRank
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-track    # Group by parallel work streams
bv --robot-triage --robot-triage-by-label    # Group by domain
```

### Understanding Robot Output

**All robot JSON includes:**

- `data_hash` — Fingerprint of source beads.jsonl
- `status` — Per-metric state: `computed|approx|timeout|skipped` + elapsed ms
- `as_of` / `as_of_commit` — Present when using `--as-of`

**Two-phase analysis:**

- **Phase 1 (instant):** degree, topo sort, density
- **Phase 2 (async, 500ms timeout):** PageRank, betweenness, HITS, eigenvector, cycles

### jq Quick Reference

```bash
bv --robot-triage | jq '.quick_ref'                        # At-a-glance summary
bv --robot-triage | jq '.recommendations[0]'               # Top recommendation
bv --robot-plan | jq '.plan.summary.highest_impact'        # Best unblock target
bv --robot-insights | jq '.status'                         # Check metric readiness
bv --robot-insights | jq '.Cycles'                         # Circular deps (must fix!)
```
