{"id":"cb-3fm","title":"Fix resize handle oscillation and multi-select resize bugs in TransformHandles","description":"## Resize Bug Fix — Agent Handoff\n\n### Problem\nResize handles on the CollabBoard whiteboard oscillate/flicker during drag and snap back to original size on release. User confirmed: \"every other rendered frame snaps it back to its original space\" — a repeating cycle until release, then it resets.\n\n### Root Cause (Confirmed)\nIn TransformHandles.tsx, the delta calculation used hx/hy derived from the bounds prop, which re-renders on every frame during drag:\n\n    const dx = node.x() - (hx - HANDLE_SIZE / 2);  // hx shifts every render!\n\n1. Frame 1: hx at original -> dx = total displacement -> correct resize\n2. Frame 2: bounds updated -> hx shifts -> dx ~ 0 -> snaps back to original\n3. Frame 3: bounds reset -> hx shifts back -> dx correct again -> resize\n4. Oscillation continues; on release, final dx is wrong -> snaps to original\n\n### What Was Fixed\nFile: apps/web/src/modules/objects/ui/TransformHandles.tsx\n- Added dragStartPosRef to capture handle position at drag start\n- Changed onDragMove and onDragEnd to compute dx/dy from dragStartPosRef (fixed reference) instead of re-rendered hx/hy\n- Fix is written, saved, HMR-confirmed, and USER-TESTED WORKING\n\n### What Was NOT Fixed Yet\n1. Multi-select proportional scaling (BoardPage.tsx:291-309) — uses selectionBounds from current render. Should work via incremental scaling but needs manual testing with 2+ selected objects.\n2. No preview/commit separation — both onResize and onResizeEnd (BoardPage.tsx:638-639) fire the same handler that commits to store on every drag frame. Causes unnecessary Firestore writes. Future optimization.\n3. Rotation handle may have a similar issue — uses centerX/bounds from closure in onDragMove. Needs testing.\n\n### Files Reviewed\n- TransformHandles.tsx — MODIFIED (the fix)\n- geometry.ts — computeResize() is correct, no changes needed\n- BoardPage.tsx — handleObjectResize at lines 291-309, TransformHandles rendered at 635-643\n- intent-handler.ts — resize intent (line 158-161) is correct\n- contracts.ts — resize intent type definition is correct\n- useObjects.ts — resizeObject hook wrapper is correct\n\n### How to Restore Testing Environment\n1. cd /Users/jake/codebases/gauntlet/collabboard\n2. bun run dev\n3. Open in Chrome, sign in, open any board\n4. Create object, select, drag corner handle to resize\n\n### What to Do Next\n1. Test multi-select resize (select 2+ objects, resize via handles)\n2. Test rotation handle for similar stale-closure issue\n3. Run bun run test to ensure no regressions\n4. Consider adding integration tests for resize flow\n5. Optional: separate preview from commit (onResize = local state, onResizeEnd = store commit)\n6. Commit when all tests pass\n\n### Current Git State\n- Branch: main\n- Modified: TransformHandles.tsx (the fix)\n- NOT committed yet","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2026-02-19T01:33:13.722760Z","created_by":"jake","updated_at":"2026-02-19T01:34:33.669109Z","closed_at":"2026-02-19T01:34:33.669063Z","close_reason":"User requested deletion; handoff no longer needed","compaction_level":0,"original_size":0}
